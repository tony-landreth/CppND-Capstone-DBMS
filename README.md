# CPPND: Capstone Repo

This is a Capstone project for the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

The project implements a database management system very loosely based on Joe Hellersteinâ€™s databases course at UC Berkeley.
In fact, don't blame Hellerstein for any of this.

Movie data from GroupLens Research is used to demonstrate the system's functionality. (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

# Project Structure  

- When a user issues a query, the QueryPlanner uses a Tokenizer to parse the query.  
- The Tokenizer stores tokens in a TokenTree.  
- Based on the contents of the TokenTree, the QueryPlanner builds a pipeline of PlanNodes.  
- Each of the major SQL operators modeled in this project have their own PlanNode subclass.  - For example, `SELECT * FROM test_data WHERE title EQUALS 'The Fall';` causes the QueryPlanner
  to build a pipeline consisting of a `FileScan -> Selection -> Projection`. Different queries require different pipelines.  

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Rubric Points Addressed  
This project doesn't use templates or concurrency features, unfortunately. Here are the
rubric items it does use:  
- [ ] A variety of control structures are used in the project.   
- [ ] The project code is clearly organized into functions.  
- [ ] The project reads data from an external file or writes data to a file as part of the necessary operation of the program. (see `FileScan`)   
- [ ] The project accepts input from a user as part of the necessary operation of the program. (see `main.cpp`)  
- [ ] The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data, and class methods to perform tasks. (see any `PlanNode` class)
- [ ] All class data members are explicitly specified as public, protected, or private. (see any `PlanNode` class)  
- [ ] All class members that are set to argument values are initialized through member initialization lists.
- [ ] All class member functions document their effects, either through function names, comments, or formal documentation. Member functions do not change program state in undocumented ways.
- [ ] Appropriate data and functions are grouped into classes. Member data that is subject to an invariant is hidden from the user. State is accessed via member functions.  
- [ ] Inheritance hierarchies are logical. Composition is used instead of inheritance when appropriate. Abstract classes are composed of pure virtual functions. Override functions are specified.  
- [ ] One function is overloaded with different signatures for the same function name. (see `TokenTree.h` constructor)
- [ ] One member function in an inherited class overrides a virtual base class member function.  
- [ ] At least two variables are defined as references, or two functions use pass-by-reference in the project code. (see `TokenTree::find` or any `PlanNode` constructor)  
- [ ] For all classes, if any one of the copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, move assignment operator, and destructor are defined, then all of these functions are defined. (see `TokenTree.h`)
- [ ] The project uses at least one smart pointer: unique_ptr, shared_ptr, or weak_ptr. The project does not use raw pointers. (see `QueryPlanner.cpp`)  




## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo, including the test submodule, like this: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tony-landreth/CppND-Capstone-DBMS.git
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`  
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`

## Running It
This is a read-only DBMS with very limited capabilities. Keep that in mind.
Assuming that you're in the same directory as the executable (probably `build/`). The following lines will run:
1. `./mildDBMS "SELECT * FROM movies;"`  
2. `./mildDBMS "SELECT movies.title, ratings.rating FROM movies JOIN ratings ON movieId = movieId;"`  
3. `./mildDBMS "SELECT movies.title, ratings.rating FROM movies JOIN ratings ON movieId = movieId WHERE title EQUALS 'Sudden Death (1995)';"`  
4. `./mildDBMS "SELECT movies.title FROM movies JOIN movies ON movieId = movieId WHERE title EQUALS 'Sudden Death (1995)';"`  

## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```
./test
```
NOTE: The test suite requires that you've installed the testing submodule. See Basic Build Instructions.
