# CPPND: Capstone Repo

This is a Capstone project for the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

The project implements a database management system based on specs from Oz Nova's course in databases at the Bradfield School of Computer Science in San Franisco, and Joe Hellersteinâ€™s databases course at UC Berkeley.
Movie data from GroupLens Research is used to demonstrate the system's functionality. (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo, including the test submodule, like this: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tony-landreth/CppND-Capstone-DBMS.git
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mildDBMS`.

## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```
./test
```
NOTE: The test suite requires that you've installed the testing submodule. See Basic Build Instructions.
